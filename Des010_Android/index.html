            <h1>Android's Mascot Story</h1>
            <p>You probably know that the <strong>Android</strong> operating system maintained by <strong>Google</strong> is one of the most used for mobile devices worldwide. But maybe you don't know that their cute pet has a name and a very curious history? Well, follow this article to learn a lot about this little robot.</p>
            <h2>The First Version</h2>
            <p>The first attempt to create a mascot came in 2007 and came from a developer called <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/dan-morrill-shows-us-the-android-mascot-that-almost-was-20130103 /" target="_blank" class="external">Dan Morrill</a>. He says that he opened the <a href="https://inkscape.org/" target="_blank" class="external">Inkscape</a> (free software for image vectoring) and created his own robot version . The goal was just to personify the system just for his team, there was no company request to create a mascot.</p>

            <p>This bizarre first version was even named after its creator: it would be the <strong>Dandroids</strong>.</p>
            <h2>A New Mascot Appears</h2>
            <p>The idea of having a mascot matured and the mission was passed on to a professional in the area. The russian illustrator <a href="https://www.irinablok.com/android" target="_blank" class="external">Irina Blok</a>, and also a Google employee, was given the mission to represent the little robot in a nicer way.</p>

            </picture>

            <p>Irina's main idea was to represent everything graphically with few strokes and in a flatter way. The design should also generate quick identification with whoever is looking at it. Then came to be the <strong>Bugdroid</strong>, the new Android mascot.</p>

            <img class="pequena" src="imagens/bugdroid.png" alt="">

            <p>The main inspiration for the features of the new <strong>Bugdroid</strong> came from those little figures that illustrate bathroom doors to indicate the gender of each door. Legend has it that the artist was creating at her desk in <strong>Google</strong>'s office and looked to the side of the bathrooms and the identification was immediate: simple, clean, objective.</p>

                <p>Another curious thing about Android is that each version has always been named after a candy, in alphabetical order from version 1.5 to 9.0.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1.5 - Cupcake</li>
                    <li>1.6 - Donut</li>
                    <li>3.0 - Eclair</li>
                    <li>2.2 - Froyo</li>
                    <li>2.3 - Gingerbread</li>
                    <li>3.0 - Honeycomb</li>
                    <li>4.0 - Ice Cream Sandwich</li>
                    <li>4.1 - Jelly Bean</li>
                    <li>4.4 - KitKat</li>
                    <li>5.0 - Lolipop</li>
                    <li>6.0 - Marshmallow</li>
                    <li>7.0 - Nougat</li>
                    <li>8.0 - Oreo</li>
                    <li>9.0 - Pie</li>
                </ul>
               
                <p>Unfortunately, the <strong>Android Q</strong> did not exist, as Google decided to put an end to this fun practice and started using numbers, which gave rise to Android 10</p>.
